# Privacy

Taxi Plate processes notifications only on the Android phone where it is installed.
Notification access is granted explicitly in Android settings and can be revoked at
any time.

Taxi Plate keeps a separate allow switch for each configured package name. The listener
checks that switch before reading notification text, parsing it, or adding it to local
diagnostics. Imported adapter bundles display all requested packages and require explicit
confirmation; newly requested packages are disabled by default. The same package choice
applies across personal, work, and private profiles, but only to notifications Android
actually delivers to the personal-profile listener.

Android's standard Notification access screen grants or revokes listener access globally;
it does not provide Taxi Plate with a per-source-app system filter. Disabling a source
app's notifications in Android settings blocks them system-wide. Work-profile policy and
Private Space state can further prevent cross-profile delivery.

The plugin extracts only the ride fields needed for its card and PIN. Current ride
state, adapter configuration, and recent diagnostics stay in the plugin's private
app storage. Taxi Plate does not upload notification contents or ride data to a
server. Diagnostic export happens only after an explicit user action and may contain
sensitive ride details; the exported file is controlled by the user.

Imported regular expressions run through the linear-time RE2/J engine, and the text passed
to matching is capped at 8192 characters per notification.

Removing the plugin deletes its private Android app data. Imported adapter files and
diagnostic exports stored outside the app remain under the user's control.
