# Taxi Plate for Rokid Nexus

Taxi Plate is a single phone-side [Rokid Nexus](https://github.com/Anezium/Rokid-Nexus)
plugin. It reads notifications through configuration-driven adapters, keeps one current
ride state across multiple enabled providers, and publishes a native Nexus PIN. Rokid Nexus is the only app that owns the
Bluetooth/CXR link and the only permanent renderer installed on the glasses.

There is no Taxi Plate APK for the glasses, no embedded helper, no Hi Rokid authorization,
and no Bluetooth permission in this project.

## Runtime flow

1. Android delivers notifications and Taxi Plate rejects every package not explicitly
   allowed in its settings before extracting text or writing diagnostics.
2. `NotificationAdapterEngine` applies the matching JSON rules and `TaxiCoordinator`
   persists the resulting ride state.
3. `NexusTaxiHudTransport` briefly connects a `NexusPluginClient`, sends one
   `showPin` or `hidePin`, and immediately disconnects.
4. Nexus keeps the text PIN in the top-right corner independently of the plugin process.
5. The Nexus phone and glasses hubs own transport, arbitration, placement, and rendering.

Opening Taxi Plate from the Nexus launcher shows the current ride status. Before pickup,
the action clears the Android notification and plate PIN. During a trip, the card keeps the
remaining travel time visible even when no PIN is showing; one center tap creates the small
arrival-timer PIN. Back only closes the launcher surface and does not dismiss the ride.

The medium PIN contains the plate, vehicle, and ETA/waiting status. It survives launcher
and surface changes, sleeping glasses, and the Taxi Plate process disconnecting; each update
refreshes its 30-minute TTL. The phone also shows one silent, dismissible Android
notification for the current ride. At trip start the plate PIN is removed. The arrival
timer PIN can be shown manually or automatically through the plugin setting. It uses the
localized `Until arrival / X min` (or hours plus minutes) layout and refreshes on minute
boundaries. Swiping its phone notification hides only that PIN; trip progress remains in
the launcher card. The trip-end notification clears the timer automatically.

## Notification adapters

The app ships with an enabled Yandex Go adapter as
`app/src/main/assets/adapters/builtin_notification_adapters.json`; it is data, not a
hard-coded parser. Settings opened from Nexus list every adapter and allow each one to be
enabled or disabled independently. Each configured package also has its own allow switch.
**Import JSON** uses Android's document picker, validates the bundle, then shows every
package it requests before anything is persisted. New packages start unchecked and the
user chooses which ones Taxi Plate may parse. Confirmed adapters are merged by `id`, so a
bundle can add Uber, a local taxi app, or replace the built-in definition. **Reset imported
adapters** returns to the built-in set.

Package choices are matched before notification extras are read and before diagnostic
logging. A choice applies to notifications with that package name from personal, work, or
private profiles when Android delivers them to the personal-profile listener. Android does
not run notification listeners inside a work profile; enterprise policy may also block
[cross-profile notification access](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-profiles).
[Private Space](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/private-space) is a
separate profile and stops while locked, so its notifications are available only when the
OS exposes them. The in-app
**How to limit notification access** opens Android's listener-detail screen for Taxi Plate.
There the user can filter the four categories shown by Pixel Settings: Notifications,
Conversations, Real-time, and Silent. **See all apps** controls notification delivery from
individual source apps. The guide also explains the profile limits
described by Android's
[`NotificationListenerService` contract](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService).

Bundles use `schemaVersion: 1`. Each adapter declares `id`, `displayName`, `packages`,
`eventRules`, `fieldRules`, optional truncation rules, activation requirements, and
`pinTtlMs`. Android countdown/`when` metadata is also captured for in-trip ETA. Field rules
can extract `TRIP_DURATION` text when a provider exposes duration in text instead. Rules
select a regex capture `group` and a closed list of transforms:
`TRIM`, `UPPERCASE`, `REMOVE_WHITESPACE`, `NORMALIZE_PLATE_LETTERS`,
`NORMALIZE_RANGE`, and `CLEAN_VEHICLE`. See
`docs/notification-adapter-example.json` for a complete custom-provider example.

Imports are limited to 256 KiB, 32 adapters, and bounded rule counts/pattern sizes. Imported
patterns are validated and executed by RE2/J, which guarantees linear-time matching and
rejects unsupported backtracking features such as lookbehind and backreferences. Matching
also uses at most 8192 notification-text characters. The entire bundle and package choice
are committed together; invalid imports leave the working configuration unchanged.

## Setup

1. Install and onboard a current Rokid Nexus release with PIN support,
   including its one glasses hub.
2. Install the Taxi Plate plugin APK on the phone.
3. In Nexus, approve the `surfaces` capability for Taxi Plate.
4. Open Taxi Plate settings from Nexus and grant Android notification-listener access.
5. Review the package switches and allow only the ride apps Taxi Plate may parse.
6. Grant the separate Android permission that lets Taxi Plate post its own notification.

The APK has no launcher activity. Nexus opens its exported settings activity explicitly.

## Settings backup

The Nexus settings screen can export and import a portable `.rpb` file. It is encrypted
with AES-256-GCM using a user-chosen password derived with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256. The app does
not save the password. The backup includes imported adapters, adapter and package choices,
the automatic trip-pin preference, and the selected language. It deliberately excludes
the current ride, ride history, notification diagnostics, and Android/Nexus permissions.

Use this export before uninstalling a debug-signed build and installing a store-signed
build. Android notification access and Nexus plugin approval still need to be granted to
the new installation.

## Build and verify

```powershell
.\scripts\taxi-hud-regression.ps1
```

The build consumes the public Nexus SDK `bus-client:sdk-v0.15.0` from JitPack.
The regression script runs unit tests, Android lint, and the debug APK build.

The single output is:

- `build\outputs\taxi-hud\Taxi-Plate-debug.apk`

The APK identity is `com.havoc.rokid.plugin.taxihudpin` and its Nexus plugin id is
`taxi-hud-pin`, so it installs beside the existing `dev.havoc.taxihud.phone` app.

To install it for the personal Android profile (user 0) on the only connected phone:

```powershell
.\scripts\taxi-hud-regression.ps1 -Install
```

Raw notification diagnostics remain local until the user explicitly exports JSONL; exported
data may contain sensitive ride details.

## Release signing

Store releases are built only from a clean tagged revision and signed with the
project's permanent PKCS12 certificate. Configure `NEXUS_RELEASE_KEYSTORE`,
`NEXUS_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, and `NEXUS_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` in the release
environment. Never commit the keystore or its passwords.
